Week 1: Introduction to Python Basics

Project: Write a Python program that:
Takes user input for their name and age.
Greets the user with a personalized message.
Calculates and prints the year they'll turn 100 years old.


Week 2: Control Structures and Functions

Project: Create a Python program that:
Takes a user's number input.
Checks if the number is even or odd using control structures (if statements).
Defines a function that calculates the factorial of the number and returns the result.


Week 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas

Project: Analyze a small dataset (e.g., a CSV file) using Pandas. Your project should include:
Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates.
Data exploration: Generating summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
A brief report explaining your findings.


Week 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Project: Create a data visualization project that:
Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends or patterns in a dataset.
Includes appropriate titles, labels, and legends.
You can choose the dataset based on your interests (e.g., housing prices, weather data).


Week 5: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

Project: Conduct a statistical analysis project that:
Selects a dataset with multiple variables.
Performs descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Formulates a hypothesis and conducts a relevant statistical test (e.g., t-test, chi-square test).
Interprets the results and draws conclusions.


Week 6: Introduction to Machine Learning

Project: Train a simple machine learning model:
Choose a dataset (e.g., a CSV file) suitable for regression or classification.
Preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) to make predictions.


Week 7: Deep Learning Basics with TensorFlow/Keras

Project: Build a basic image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras:
Select a dataset of images (e.g., digits, cats vs. dogs).
Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).
Create a deep neural network with at least one hidden layer.
Train the model and evaluate its performance using accuracy.


Week 8: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Project: Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering to a dataset:
Handle categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Implement feature scaling or normalization.
Create new meaningful features.
Train and compare machine learning models with and without feature engineering.


Week 9: Advanced Machine Learning Concepts

Project: Implement an ensemble learning project:
Choose a dataset suitable for classification or regression.
Train and evaluate an ensemble model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Compare the ensemble model's performance with a single base model.


Week 10: Capstone Project

Project: For your capstone project, you have the freedom to choose a specific area of interest within data science and machine learning. Ensure your project includes:
A clear problem statement and project goal.
Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
Model selection and training.
Evaluation metrics and interpretation of results.
A well-documented report or presentation summarizing your project.
These detailed project requirements should provide you with clear guidance for each week's project, helping you apply what you've learned and gain hands-on experience in Python for data science and machine learning.
